# AmpliconArchitect (AA) Results Viewer

This MDI app provides an interactive interface for exploring the results generated by the **AmpliconArchitect** tool, typically run on the Great Lakes HPC cluster.

**Purpose:** To facilitate the interpretation and visualization of focal amplicon structures identified by AA from Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data.

**Input Data:** This app expects a data package containing standard output files from an AmpliconArchitect run, including:

- Summary file (`*_summary.txt`)
- Graph files (`*_graph.txt`)
- Cycle files (`*_cycle.txt`)
- SV view images (`*.png` or `*.pdf`) - _Optional_

**Planned Features:**

- Display summary information for detected amplicons.
- Visualize breakpoint graphs and cycle decompositions.
- Allow interactive filtering and exploration of SVs and copy number data.
- Potentially integrate with SV view images.
